We can observe that movies and TV shows dramatically increase in the past decade. However, it slowed down since 2019.<br>
It should be influenced by COVIN-19 in 2019.<br><br>
In top 10 countries, USA and UK are not surprisingly in top 1 and top 3, but India is top 2.<br>

In top 10 countries, there are huge different preference on Movies and TV Shows. Movies are more likely released in India, and TV shows are more popular in S. Korea. <br>
Maybe Indians are interested in Bollywood, so Netflix offers more movies. On the other hands, S. Korea is well-known with their TV shows, such as squid game, thus it is in expectation that S. Korea has more TV shows on Netflix.<br/>

It is clearly that movies and TV shows reduced after 2019. Now, we found that TV shows still have slightly increase while movies have significantly decreased. Maybe it is because COVID-19 caused film industry stop filming temporarily.<br>

Here we check movies and TV shows trend in each top 10 countries and find that TV shows actually increased in USA after 2019.<br>
It is possible that most americans need to stay at home and they are more likely to watch TV shows, so Netflix releases more TV shows to meet their preferences.
